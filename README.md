Videogames are one of my favorite past times. As a player who participates in ranked play, I've always kept my eye on the forefront of global competitions. One of the most notable games to establish an international competitive scene backed by paid professionals was the real-time strategy game (RTS) Starcraft II (SC2). In 2013 the top 10 starcraft players made nearly four-million dollars from their combined winnings @Winnings2019. Watching top-caliber players reflexes and control is astonishing to even seasoned videogame enthusiasts. At the 2019 StarCraft II World Championship Finale, many others and I packed into the arena to see what these professions could do firsthand.

The eye-watering speeds they perform at is universally referenced in gaming terminology as actions per minute (APMS). Professionals take actions at such fast speeds (high APMS); it becomes challenging to follow their overall strategy. Past pondering their sheer speed, I found it difficult to distinctly define what made these players high skilled.

To learn more about what defines talent in SC2 this analysis, we will explore in-game metrics to explain rank in competitive mode.
